					You'll need two objects of the same color to use as paddles. In my first 
					video I used my iPhone and iPod but here I'm just using a blue square I drew.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: The way I have this setup makes it more of an art than a science to select your
					paddle. As you work it will help to remember the goal here is to make 
					the pixels of your paddle in the lower preview screen be the the only 
					white pixels present (though I do account for some noise in my code).
				</p>
				<p>
					My basic process has been:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Select range of the Hue you want with the H slider.</li>
					<li>Select range the Saturation, how rich is the color you're selecting, you want with the S slider.</li>
					<li>Finally select the value of your color with the V slider. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					When you hit the "Calibrated" button, your selections will be saved and reloaded when you rebrowse.
